## Local Development

### 1. Set up ComfyUI server

First, clone and setup [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) if you haven't already.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
```

Then, modify `ComfyUI/server.py` to add CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to responses from the server. Adding the below code blocks will allow our CivitUI Next.js app to access resources on the ComfyUI server.

```python
@web.middleware
async def cors_handler(request: web.Request, handler):
    response = await handler(request)
    response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
    response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'POST, GET, OPTIONS'
    response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Content-Type, Authorization, x-requested-with'
    return response
```

```python
class PromptServer():
...
    self.app = web.Application(client_max_size=20971520, middlewares=[cache_control, cors_handler]) # Add cors_handler middleware
...
```

Finally, start the ComfyUI server:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Set up CivitUI

Now, clone the CivitUI repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/civitai/CivitUI.git
```

Add a `.env` file with the environment variables from [`.env.example`](.env.example).

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMFYUI_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188
CIVITAI_API_KEY=
```

Then, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

With your ComfyUI server running in `http://127.0.0.1:8188`, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Voila! ðŸ«¡
